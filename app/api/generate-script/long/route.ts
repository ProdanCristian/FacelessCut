ORIGINAL SCRIPT:
${customScript}

CUSTOM SCRIPT OPTIMIZATION REQUIREMENTS (FISH AUDIO COMPLIANT):
- PRESERVE ALL ORIGINAL CONTENT - Do not change, add, or remove any words from the user's script
- STEP 1: Split the script into individual sentences (look for periods, exclamation marks, question marks)
- STEP 2: Put each sentence on its own line with \\n separators
- STEP 3: Add ONE emotion tag at the very beginning of each sentence
- STEP 4: Add (break) or (long-break) timing cues between sentences where natural pauses occur

SENTENCE DIVISION RULES:
- Split at: periods (.), exclamation marks (!), question marks (?)
- Each sentence gets its own line
- Preserve exact wording of each sentence
- Add appropriate emotion tag based on sentence content and context

Choose emotion tags from: (angry), (sad), (disdainful), (excited), (surprised), (satisfied), (unhappy), (anxious), (hysterical), (delighted), (scared), (worried), (indifferent), (upset), (impatient), (nervous), (guilty), (scornful), (frustrated), (depressed), (panicked), (furious), (empathetic), (embarrassed), (reluctant), (disgusted), (keen), (moved), (proud), (relaxed), (grateful), (confident), (interested), (curious), (confused), (joyful), (disapproving), (negative), (denying), (astonished), (serious), (sarcastic), (conciliative), (comforting), (sincere), (sneering), (hesitating), (yielding), (painful), (awkward), (amused)

EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATION:
INPUT: "This is my custom script about motivation. I want to inspire people! Success comes to those who work hard. Do you believe in yourself?"

OUTPUT:
(confident)This is my custom script about motivation.
\\n(break)
\\n(excited)I want to inspire people!
\\n(break)
\\n(serious)Success comes to those who work hard.
\\n(break)
\\n(curious)Do you believe in yourself?

CRITICAL: The output must show each sentence on a separate line with proper emotion tags.

CRITICAL: Return your response as a valid JSON object:
{
  "scripts": [

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Escape all quotes inside the script using \\"
- Keep script as single string without line breaks
- Return ONLY the JSON object, no markdown code blocks, no other text
- Make sure the JSON is valid and parseable`

üö® CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA - NO EXCEPTIONS:
- TARGET: EXACTLY ${targetCharacters} characters per script
- ACCEPTABLE: ${Math.round(targetCharacters * 0.99)} to ${Math.round(targetCharacters * 1.01)} characters (¬±1% ONLY)
- MANDATORY: Script must be within this range for long-format success

üéØ LONG-FORMAT TOPIC: ${enhancedPrompt}

üìñ FOR ${targetCharacters} CHARACTERS LONG-FORMAT, YOUR SCRIPT MUST INCLUDE:
1. Compelling hook and introduction (800-1200 characters)
2. 6-10 main sections with comprehensive explanations (1500-2000 characters each)
3. Multiple detailed examples, case studies, and real-world applications
4. Personal anecdotes, expert insights, and industry perspectives

üö® FINAL CHARACTER COUNT CHECKPOINT FOR LONG-FORMAT:
1. Count EVERY single character: letters, spaces, punctuation, emotion tags, EVERYTHING
2. Required range: ${Math.round(targetCharacters * 0.99)} to ${Math.round(targetCharacters * 1.01)} characters

4. Above ${Math.round(targetCharacters * 1.01)}? CONDENSE content while maintaining quality
5. Keep iterating until EXACTLY ${Math.round(targetCharacters * 0.99)}-${Math.round(targetCharacters * 1.01)} characters
6. Triple-check your final count before submitting

üíº LONG-FORMAT REQUIREMENT: User needs ${scriptLength} seconds = ${targetCharacters} characters of comprehensive content
