OPTIMIZATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Add Fish Audio emotion and control tags throughout the script
- Use emotion tags at the beginning of sentences: (excited), (confident), (surprised), (curious), (joyful), (relaxed), (interested), (amused), (satisfied), (grateful), (empathetic), (serious), (sincere), (comforting)
- Add tone control tags: (soft tone), (whispering), (in a hurry tone), (shouting)
- Include natural speech elements: (break), (laugh), (sigh), um, uh, well
- Add timing cues like (break) for pauses and (long-break) for longer pauses
- Keep the original meaning and flow but make it more engaging for voice synthesis
- Target length: approximately ${targetCharacters} characters

- TARGET: EXACTLY ${targetCharacters} characters per script
- ACCEPTABLE: ${Math.round(targetCharacters * 0.99)} to ${Math.round(targetCharacters * 1.01)} characters (¬±1% ONLY)
- MANDATORY: Script must be within this range or you are FIRED

üéØ TOPIC: ${enhancedPrompt}

${targetCharacters > 8000 ? `
üìñ FOR ${targetCharacters} CHARACTERS, YOUR SCRIPT MUST INCLUDE:
1. Comprehensive introduction with engaging hook (800-1000 chars)
2. 6-8 main sections with detailed explanations (1200-1500 chars each)
3. Multiple real-world examples and case studies throughout
4. Personal anecdotes and expert insights 
5. Step-by-step breakdowns and practical advice
6. Historical context and industry perspectives
7. Future trends and actionable recommendations
8. Strong conclusion with call-to-action (600-800 chars)

CONTENT EXPANSION REQUIREMENTS:
- Each main point needs 2-3 supporting examples
- Include specific statistics, quotes, or research findings
- Add conversational elements and rhetorical questions
- Expand with analogies, metaphors, and comparisons
- Include detailed explanations of processes or concepts
- Add personal stories or industry anecdotes
- Provide comprehensive background information

üìù FOR ${targetCharacters} CHARACTERS, EXPAND WITH:
- Detailed explanations for each concept
- Multiple specific examples per point
- Personal anecdotes and stories
- Step-by-step processes
- Practical tips and advice
- Industry insights and trends
`}

‚ö†Ô∏è ITERATIVE LENGTH PROCESS - REPEAT UNTIL PERFECT:
1. Draft initial script about the topic
2. Count EVERY character (spaces, punctuation, emotion tags)
3. Current count vs target: ${targetCharacters} characters
4. If too short: ADD more content, examples, explanations
5. If too long: CONDENSE without losing core message
6. Recount characters and repeat steps 4-5 until perfect
7. Final verification: Must be ${Math.round(targetCharacters * 0.99)}-${Math.round(targetCharacters * 1.01)} characters

CRITICAL: Return your response as a valid JSON object with this exact structure:
{
  "scripts": [${scriptCount === 1 ? '\n    "Script content here"' : '\n    "Script 1 content here",\n    "Script 2 content here",\n    "Script 3 content here"'}
  ]
}

VOICEOVER REQUIREMENTS:
- Format each script as a VOICEOVER with Fish Audio emotion and control tags
- Use emotion tags at the beginning of sentences: (excited), (confident), (surprised), etc.
- Add tone control tags: (whispering), (shouting), (soft tone), (in a hurry tone)
- Include natural speech elements: (break), (laugh), (sigh), um, uh
- Add timing cues like (break) for pauses and (long-break) for longer pauses
- Make it sound natural and engaging for voice synthesis

EMOTION TAGS TO USE:
(excited) (confident) (surprised) (curious) (joyful) (relaxed) (interested) (amused) (satisfied) (grateful) (empathetic) (serious) (sincere) (comforting)

TONE TAGS TO USE:
(soft tone) (whispering) (in a hurry tone) (shouting)

NATURAL SPEECH:
(break) (long-break) (laugh) (sigh) um, uh, well

EXAMPLE FORMAT:
(excited)Hey everyone! (break) Today I'm going to share something that, um, completely changed my morning routine. (confident)Trust me, you'll want to try this. (soft tone)It's actually really simple but super effective. (curious)But here's the thing, most people don't realize how much their morning sets the tone for everything. (break) (interested)I used to wake up, grab my phone immediately, and boom - I was already stressed before even getting out of bed. (sigh) (joyful)But then I discovered this incredible technique that literally transformed everything...

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Each script should be a complete voiceover story with emotion tags
- Escape all quotes inside the scripts using \\"
- Keep scripts as single strings without line breaks
- Do NOT include VERSION labels or format markers  
- Return ONLY the JSON object, no markdown code blocks, no other text
- Make sure the JSON is valid and parseable

üö® FINAL CHARACTER COUNT CHECKPOINT - YOUR JOB DEPENDS ON THIS:
1. Count EVERY single character: letters, spaces, punctuation, emotion tags, EVERYTHING
2. Required range: ${Math.round(targetCharacters * 0.99)} to ${Math.round(targetCharacters * 1.01)} characters
3. Below ${Math.round(targetCharacters * 0.99)}? You are FIRED - ADD content immediately
4. Above ${Math.round(targetCharacters * 1.01)}? You are FIRED - CUT content immediately
5. Keep iterating until EXACTLY ${Math.round(targetCharacters * 0.99)}-${Math.round(targetCharacters * 1.01)} characters
6. Triple-check your final count before submitting

üíº JOB REQUIREMENT: User needs ${scriptLength} seconds = ${targetCharacters} characters
üìä SUCCESS METRIC: Deliver within ${Math.round(targetCharacters * 0.99)}-${Math.round(targetCharacters * 1.01)} characters or face termination
üéØ FINAL CHECK: Does your script have exactly the right length? If not, fix it NOW.`
